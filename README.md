# WAITQR-webapp
Makes ordering quick and hassle free!

With most people skeptical about going out to eat due to sanitization concerns, hotels are finding it difficult to assure customers their safety. Hence, we intend to bridge the gap between customers and businesses by providing a safer environment to interact in. WAITQR makes ordering hassle free by giving you access to hotels' menus with just a scan.

Even though there are a lot of online delivery apps, people still prefer going out occasionally with their family. We want to make sure they have the best family time!

With so many small business having at least 20-30% of the profit taken by the delivery apps, they find it difficult to sustain. This is when WAITQR comes into picture. All those customers wanting to have the full experience of eating in restaurant can do so without worrying about their safety and, the small businesses will have full control over how much they earn.

WAITQR web-app is light-weight and vouches for helping people get their orders placed faster. This also helps lessen the chaos and confusion that occurs when waiters are taking customers' orders and potential misplacement.
